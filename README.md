# Tap3
Mobile game for iOS and Android

HOW IT WORKS
Tap 3 is a arcade brain game. Nine tiles appear on screen each round, and are randomly assigned a color, shape, and drawing style.
Each round, the game randomly decides on a matching rule (colors, shapes, or styles).
At least 3 shapes will be randomly assigned the same requirements as the rule.
The player must find the correct tiles and tap them to progress and increase their score.

WHERE TO LOOK
Everything of interest is in the "Classes" folder.
You will need to reference the "NRG_Engine" repository to see the source code for all "nrg" objects.
Ignore all the other folders. They are there for version control.
