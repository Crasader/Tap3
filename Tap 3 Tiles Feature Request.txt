Tap 3 Tiles September 29th Release

[BODY]
Hi, [NAME]. If I could borrow 5 minutes of your time, I'd like you to consider including my latest mobile game to be featured in the App Store for Puzzle - Match games. 

Tap 3 Tiles is a cleanly-designed, intuitive matching game with focus and fast reflexes at the heart of its challenge. It's a single tap game. No complex controls, but it is far from easy. I searched the app store for an idea as simple as this, and when I didn't find it, I knew I had to make the game.

You can view the trailer / app preview video here:

I'm an indie developer, so I designed all the art, sound, and gameplay for Tap 3.
